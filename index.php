    <div class="text1">The truth is, if you want to retire young and enjoy your life,
      paying off your mortgage is the first step</div>

    <div class="tick2"></div>
    <div class="text2">Sadly, most Australians
      will never pay off their mortgage and are forced to sell their
      family home.</div>

    <div class="tick3"></div>
    <div class="text3"> Aussies carry more debt than citizens of nearly any
      other country, and according to ABS, the vast majority will have to
      sell their home to retire.</div>

    <div class="tick4"></div>
    <div class="text4">If you owe on your mortgage in your 60s,
      superannuation isn't enough to cover the payment, upkeep, lifestyle,
      living expenses, and medications. </div>

    <div class="tick5"></div>
    <div class="text5"> Besides, you might have to move to
      an undesirable area of town, or perhaps to another state, to afford
      your housing. This doesn’t have to happen to you if you do something
      now. It all boils down to this.</div>

    <div class="tick6"></div>
    <div class="text6">You can pay off your mortgage long
      before it’s time to retire and get the government to foot most, if
      not all, of the bill..</div>
